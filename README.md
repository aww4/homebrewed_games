# Homebrewed Games
I am Annie and I love to make up games that don't exist. Though many have made excellent original games, I most love games from pillaged pieces and boards of other games. I use this repository to share the rules for games I've made up, and I invite you to write up rules for games you've made and share them here too. I would love for this to become a collaborative silly repo for silly games space!

All games are mostly play tested on two married people, and most have elements you may not be enthusiastic about letting your weird neighbor have the same rules you and an S.O. might have. Adapt at will - this is all about rules and goals.

# Navigating this repo

basics --> information that applies across games, such as recommendations for how to build a game closet meant to be taken apart and our house Rules

games --> where word docs using the template go to explain new games. As this grows, some games might graduate to having folders containing multiple variations

the template: please use the template in the main folder to write out how a game should be played! game instructions that are not in this format will not be accepted.
