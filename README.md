# What the Hell Is This
I am Annie and I love to make up games that don't exist. I use pieces from games you likely have some or many of in your house. Our house rules, games we own, and drinks we recommend can all be found in the "basics" folder. Each game has its own document with rules and images. Questions and feedback are welcomed! All games are mostly play tested on two married people, and most have elements you may not be enthusiastic about letting your weird neighbor have the same rules you and an S.O. might have. Adapt at will - this is all about rules and goals.

# True American

Since no other guide out there on the internet really fleshes out a game that actually works to play, I have learned from trial and error how to adapt the general principles of the beloved New Girl favorite into something you can actually do, and I am happy to share what has become the final version we now play as a friend group. It’s not as close to what’s in the show as some other rule sets floating around out there, but I promise the tradeoffs away from what’s in the tv version have all been to make it so it's actually a fun game that works well and your friends will like.

# CandyMericaLadders

There are a few versions presented in the rules, but the general principle across all my variations is to move many pieces across a variety of game boards (Candyland, an American trivia game, and Chutes and Ladders). The key here is that pieces carry an advantage when they match the board they're on and have penalties when on a board they didn't come home from the store with. This game is best if you have several hours to kill; it results in much more alcohol consumption than other games listed here.

# Sorry! For the Crusades

This game is a cross of Sorry! and King's Cup. House King's Cup rules are in the "basics" folder. In addition, there's a chess component thrown in for side bonus points. Lasts only slightly longer than regular Sorry games; moderate drinking. Can't get too sloshed on the way to reclaiming the holy land!

# The Loch Chess Monster

This game is chess. With the small exception that there are no actual chess pieces on the board. They are instead taken from other games and assume mostly similar powers to their chess counterparts. If you are very good with your bishops, you'll get away largely sober. If you're a rook or queen gal, I am sorry to say you will be enjoying your wins shitfaced. Changes to the powers of the knight make this a pretty fast game
