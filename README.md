Since no other guide out there on the internet really fleshes out a game that actually works to play, I have learned from trial and error how to adapt the general principles of the beloved New Girl favorite into something you can actually do, and I am happy to share what has become the final version we now play as a friend group. It’s not as close to what’s in the show as some other rule sets floating around out there, but I promise the tradeoffs away from what’s in the tv version have all been to make it so it's actually a fun game that works well and your friends will like.

Full rules are in the PDF.
