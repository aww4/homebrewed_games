# King's Cup
Ace: Waterfall (started/controlled by the person to the left of they who drew the ace)
2: You
3: Me
4: Pour (this is the only time you're allowed to refill your drinks without penalty! Good for pacing; if you run out before the next 4 is played, you're on the hook for a shot made by another player. Drink responsibly fellas)
5: Guys
6*: Chicks
7: Heaven
8: Mate (make the penis in vagina hand symbol first; mates works fine when there's like four or more of you, but we found it very dull when playing with 2)
9: Signs (mirror movements when playing with 2; round of thumper with 3 or more)
10: Categories
Jack/11: Three finger Never Have I Ever
Queen/12*: Queens/Queen (if in a deck without 6's, ladies drink; otherwise the lady who most recently went including whomever drew the card gets to make up a new rule, punishable by shots. House go to drinking rules are below. If no one in your group identifies as a woman, way to invent democracy! Everyone votes on their sovereign who is unbound by their gender)
King/Sorry: Pick the next song in the playlist because I am too damn old to be drinking rumblehooch

*Sorry for some reason omits 6 and 9, so 12 becomes women drink and signs just disappears into the foreverland

# Go-To Drinking Rules to Add to a Game
1. The Macaulay Culkin: The rule maker at any point may place his hands on his cheeks, a la Home Alone. The last person to copy drinks a shot.
2. You Sure About That?: Everything has to sound like it ends in a? question mark?
3. The Narcissus: Everyone, including myself, compliment me every time they have to drink. No repeating compliments allows for some very strange but hilarious compliments.
4. The King and I: For the rest of the game no one's head can be above mine. Any time that it is they drink.
5. The Riddler: Every question has to start with "riddle me this".
6. Gentleman's Rules: No pointing. No swearing. No 'drink/drank/drunk'
7. Swine Rules: You must point at the person you're talking to and swear in every sentence.
8. The Madam President: When you speak, you have to put your 2 fingers
to your ear as if you are part of the President's security detail, communicating with other personnel.
9. The T-Rex: Shove your arms in your sleeves to look like a T-Rex
10. The Safety First: Undo your invisible seat belt whenever you get up. Put it back on when you sit down.
11. The House of Parliament: You can only refer to people as "My right-honourable friend/The right-honourable lady from <street name>", and raise any accusation of rule breaking by addressing "Madam Speaker"
12. The MOOSE!: When the rule-maker says moose, you have to put your hands on your head to resemble moose antlers
13. The Splash Zone: People either side of someone drinking also drink
14. The Tea and Crumpets: All players must hold their beer with the fancy pinky
